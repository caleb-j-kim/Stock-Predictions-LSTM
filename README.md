# Stock-Predictions-LSTM

An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is designed to make predictions based on sequential data. 
For context, an RNN is a type of artificial neural network thatâ€™s designed for processing sequential data, where the current output depends on the current input along with previous inputs. 
These neural networks use a concept known as a feedback loop to retain information through the processing of a Machine Learning model; specifically, this handles data with temporal or sequential relationships such as text, speech, or time-series data. 
However, unlike traditional RNNs, LSTMs solve a common issue known as a vanishing gradient problem which is when the gradients of the loss function approach zero, making it difficult for the model to learn long-term dependencies well. 
LSTMs fix this issue and are thus well equipped with time-series and sequential data. 
This makes LSTMs extremely useful when calculating stock predictions as they are more accurate in making correct predictions, compared to other traditional models. 
LSTMs in a non-linear data world make them extremely popular especially in stock trading. 
Our goal is to create a model that makes stock prices more predictable for safer investments.
